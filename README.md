# ZodiacMatch

## Introduction
In this project I will analyze a dataset provided by Codecademy in order to put my recently aquired skills of ML and Data Science into practice. The data is from the online dating application OKCupid and I will be preparing, analyzing this data to create a machine learning model to predict the zodiac sign of a user given their characteristics.

## Libraries Used
Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Confusion Matrix

## Project Development
First, I created some visualizations using Seaborn charts that gave me a solid first glance at how data is distributed in the dataset. After observing how different variables (age, sex, income, gender, diet habits, etc.) are distirbuted, I started to consider which models would be good to use for prediction and decided that KNN, Decision Trees and Logistic Regression would be good choices considering they are all classifiers but work in different ways. This would give me the opportunity to analyze the results from all the models and realize what makes one model better than the others for this specific case.


## Model Training and Testing
